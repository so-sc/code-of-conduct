# code-of-conduct

Welcome to Sahyadri Open-Source Community, We are a community of tech enthusiasts working hard to spread knowledge and strengthen the collaborative culture among the young minds. SOSC was born through the convergence of Technical clubs at Sahyadri, namely, Mozilla Campus Club, Developer Students Club and some aspiring individuals who are keen to share their knowledge for the community.

As the name suggests, SOSC is a community. Whenever you talk, post or reply, there are other people hearing you or sitting behind the screen reading what you say. These other people have thoughts, ideas, dreams, aspirations, troubles, advice, perspectives, feelings, and experiences, just like you. You'll probably end up meeting a lot of them if you volunteer or participate in events like Hackathons or conferences. Everyone in this group and people you meet through the community events are a potential new friend -treat them that way.

This document aims to make SOSC a place for everyone to feel welcome. The rules, guidelines, and code of conduct that follow apply to all the Core Members, volunteers and participants, although subgroups may also extend these to better serve their own community. This isn't an exhaustive list of things that you can't do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it's intended — a guide to make it easier to be excellent to each other. We expect it to be followed in spirit as much as in the letter.

#### Be considerate
Any decision you take will affect other members and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions. Try to make decisions that are as inclusive as possible.
#### Be respectful
Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It's important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. We expect members of the Sahyadri Open-Source Community to be respectful when communicating with other community members, as well as with people outside SOSC.
#### Be Collaborative 
What we produce is a complex whole made of many parts, it is the sum of many dreams. Collaboration between teams that each have their own goal and vision is essential; for the whole to be more than the sum of its parts, each part must make an effort to understand the whole.  
  
Collaboration reduces redundancy and improves the quality of our work. Internally and externally, we celebrate good collaboration. Wherever possible, we work closely with [Sahyadri College of Engineering](https://www.sahyadri.edu.in) and other startups and communities with the open-source and non-profit motto to coordinate our efforts. We prefer to work transparently and involve interested parties as early as possible.
#### Be nice and Do not harass others  
Everyone in this community should feel welcome, regardless of their background. Please be courteous, respectful and polite to fellow community members. Any complaints regrading any of the following will be taken seriously and may result in removing from the community/Event.  
Harassment includes:
- Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness,  physical appearance, body size, race, or religion.
- Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour in spaces where they’re not appropriate.
- Physical contact and simulated physical contact through texts without consent or after a request to stop.
- Threats of violence.
- Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm.
- Deliberate intimidation.
- Stalking or Following.
- Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes.
- Sustained disruption of discussion.
- Unwelcome sexual attention.  
ie. Meetup organizing members and other volunteer members should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment. 
- Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others.

If asked to stop any harassing behavior, you are expected to comply immediately. If a participant/member engages in harassing behavior, the meetup organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event.  
If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please follow the directions in the "Contact us" section, at the end of this document.  
Organizers will be happy to help participants/members contact security or local law enforcement, provide escorts to an alternate location, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the meetup. We value your attendance.  
  
We expect participants to follow these rules at our all of our event venues and event-related social events.  
#### Communicate effectively
We don't all speak the same language at the same skill level. Clear communication can help to avoid misunderstandings, as can remembering that our interpretations of words can be different depending on our backgrounds. Having context is important. It's better to ask for clarification than to make assumptions. Disagreements, social and technical, are normal, but we expect members in the community to resolve disagreements constructively — so please avoid flamewars, trolling, personal attacks, and repetitive arguments.
#### Unaffilated Promotions
Any promotions which are not directly affiliated to the community should be completely avoided, if found continuing even after asked to stop may result in removal from the event/community. All the members/organizers/sponsors/participants shall ask permission with  concerned people mentioned at the end of the document to carry-out any promotions within the community discussion rooms or events.

If any member breaks the code of conduct of SOSC, Community leads will take the decision and they will be out of community activities For 6 months But if community leads decide the situation mistake made by someone is bad He will be removed from the community.
